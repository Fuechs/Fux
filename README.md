**`Flawless Unambiguous Programming`**


## The Beautiful Alternative For C++ 

<p align="center">

## Why Fux?

### Flexible, Portable, Fast

- At least as high performant as C++
- Using LLVM to compile and run on several paltforms

### Easy To Learn

- Already known environment for developers with experience in C++
- Pythonic features: automatic typing, inbuilt string type, simple arrays, safe memory managment

### Large Standard Library

- Fux ships with a large standard library packed with utility ready to be used
- This includes but is not limited to
    - Console IO
    - File IO
    - Math
    - Algorithms

### More Readable Code

- Variable and function types are declared after the name, making reading the code natural
- The pipe operators (`<<`, `>>`) are a core feature of Fux and make it easy to avoid nesting functions
- Variables, functions and classes can be defined without the usage of a single keyword


## State

### Roadmap

- [&check;] `Error System` 
- [&check;] `Lexer`
- [...] `Parser`
- [&cross;] `AST Analysis`
- [&cross;] `IR Generation (LLVM)`
- [&cross;] `Optimization (LLVM)`
- [&cross;] `Compilation (LLVM)`
- [...] `Runtime`
- [...] `Syntax`
- [...] `Standard Library`

Fux is currently still in early development. There is no working compiler avaiable for this language. 

As of now, I am focusing on refining the syntax of Fux, since some aspects are not cleared up yet.
I took inspiration from C++, D, Python, Odin, Elixir and Holy C.
