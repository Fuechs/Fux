**`Flawless Unambiguous Programming`**


## The beautiful alternative for C++ 

- so you don't shoot yourself in the foot (like I do working on Fux)
- with better errors (well, better than just `Segmentation fault`) 
- providing a large standard library

> More examples [`here`](#examples).

## Why Fux?

To be a valid alternative to C++ to experienced developers and the go-to language for newbies looking into learning their first programming language, Fux is very flexible.

While it is possible to program in a pythonic style,

```cpp
name := "Fuechs";
```

C++ developers can find strict typing and already known features like references very useful.

```cpp
number: f32 = 1.0;
address -> f32 = number;
```

> As already mentioned above, Fux ships with a large standard library, ready to use.
> It includes, but is not limited to, Utility, (File) IO and Maths. 

## Setup

Since Fux is still in an early development stage, there are no setup methods yet.

## Roadmap

- [&check;] `Error`
- [&check;] `Lexer`
- [...] `Parser`
- [&cross;] `AST Analysis`
- [&cross;] `Optimization`
- [&cross;] `Code Generation`
- [&cross;] `Virtual Machine`
- [...] `Runtime`
- [...] `Syntax`
- [...] `Standard Library`
