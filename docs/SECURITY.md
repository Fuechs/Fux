## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. \
Email `fuechsss@gmail.com` or use Githubs [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature instead.
